# Abstract

The Japanese commercial and residential real estate markets, with a combined estimated value surpassing 35 trillion US dollars, present a significant opportunity for investors. Accurate forecasting of rents and prices could provide a substantial competitive edge in this market. This paper investigates the potential of using alternative data variables to predict the performance of real estate in 1100 municipalities across Japan.

To test this hypothesis, a comprehensive house price index is constructed for all Japanese municipalities from 2005 to the present, utilizing a dataset containing over 5 million transactions. This core dataset is then enriched with economic factors for each municipality spanning the past few decades. Using this enhanced dataset, price trajectories are predicted for each municipality.

The findings indicate that alternative data variables can indeed forecast real estate perfor- mance. Investment signals based on these variables yielded considerable positive returns with low volatility. For instance, the net migration ratio delivered an annualized return of 4.6% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.5, while taxable income growth and new dwellings ratio recorded annualized returns of 4.1% (Sharpe ratio of 1.3) and 3.3% (Sharpe ratio of 0.9), respectively. Furthermore, when these variables are combined with the power of transformer models to predict risk-adjusted returns 4 years in advance, the model achieves an R-squared score of 0.28, explaining nearly 30 percent of the variation in future municipality prices.

These findings underscore the need for further research to identify additional factors that can enhance the prediction of real estate performance. Nevertheless, the results provide compelling evidence that alternative data variables can be valuable tools for real estate investors. By harnessing these data sources, investors can gain deeper insights into the drivers of real estate prices and make more informed investment decisions in the Japanese market.
