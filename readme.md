# Abstract

The Japanese commercial and residential real estate markets have a combined estimated size of more than 35 trillion US dollars. For investors in this market, accurate forecasting of rents and prices would be a significant competitive advantage.

This paper tests the claim that alternative data variables can be used to predict the performance of real estate in a location. I create a house price index for all the municipalities in Japan from 2005 to present, from a dataset of 10 million+ transactions. This forms the core dataset, which is enriched with economic factors for the municipalities over the last few decades.

Using this dataset and the power of Transformer models, I try to predict price trajectories for each municipality. The results show that it is possible to predict the performance of real estate in a location with the use of alternative data variables, but the predictive power is limited by the quality and quantity of the factors.

My findings suggest that more research is needed to identify additional factors that can be used to predict real estate performance. However, the results do provide some evidence that alternative data variables can be useful for real estate investors. By leveraging these data sources, investors can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that are driving real estate prices and make more informed investment decisions.
